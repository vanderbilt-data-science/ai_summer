        "# Introduction to Gradio for Hugging Face\n",
        "\n",
        "Hugging Face is an excellent platform to build and share your AI and ML models. One of the best ways to share the models you develop is by creating interactive web-based applications. These applications not only allow you to share your work with others who might be working on similar problems or those without a technical background, but building these applications also help you test your models and better understand how they work. \n",
        "\n",
        "Creating such web-based applications has traditionally been difficult since it required knowledge of how to host applications on the web, in addition to the various programming languages needed to build the applications from the ground up like HTML, CSS and Java. \n",
        "\n",
        "Gradio elimiates the need to know how to program in these other languages. In addtion, the integration with Hugging Face spaces allows you to host your application on the web, for free - in just a few lines of code!\n",
        "\n",
        "Today, we'll cover some of the major components of Gradio. Several parts of this session today are inspired by the Hugging Face course on Gradio available here: [Gradio Hugging Face Course](https://www.gradio.app/getting_started/)\n",
        "\n",
        "So let's get started! The first step is to install Gradio. This can be done using a simple pip install on your local machine. Since we'll be using Google Colab today, we will also need to install it here. "

        "This simple example introduces 5 concepts that underlie Blocks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Blocks allow you to build web applications that combine markdown, HTML, buttons, and interactive components simply by instantiating objects in Python inside of a \"with gradio.Blocks\" context. The order in which you instantiate components matters as each element gets rendered into the web app in the order it was created. (More complex layouts are discussed below)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. You can define regular Python functions anywhere in your code and run them with user input using BLocks. In our example, we have a simple function that adds a welcome message before a user's name, but you can write any Python function, from a simple calculation to large machine learning model's inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. You can assign events to any Blocks component. This will run your function when the component is clicked/changed/etc. When you assign an event, you pass in three parameters: fn: the function that should be called, inputs: the (list) of input component(s), and outputs: the (list) of output components that should be called.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we run the update() function when the value in the Textbox named inp changes. The event reads the value in inp, passes it as the name parameter to update(), which then returns a value that gets assigned to our second Textbox named out.\n",
        "\n",
        "To see a list of events that each component supports, see the documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Blocks automatically figures out whether a component should be interactive (accept user input) or not, based on the event triggers you define. In our example, the first textbox is interactive, since its value is used by the update() function. The second textbox is not interactive, since its value is never used as an input. In some cases, you might want to override this, which you can do by passing the appropriate boolean to interactive, a parameter that every component accepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. You can write and launch() your Blocks anywhere: jupyter notebooks, colab notebooks, or regular Python IDEs since Gradio uses the standard Python interpreter. You can also share Blocks with other people by setting a single parameter: launch(share=True), which we will discuss towards the end of this guide."

        "#The Amazon rainforest (Portuguese: Floresta Amazônica or Amazônia; Spanish: Selva Amazónica, Amazonía or usually Amazonia; French: Forêt amazonienne; Dutch: Amazoneregenwoud), also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle, is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 square kilometres (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations. The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. States or departments in four nations contain \"Amazonas\" in their names. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species."
